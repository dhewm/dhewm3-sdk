Install:
- delete the old "maledict" mod folder
- extract the zip file in the doom3 folder
- run the mod with the bat file... or load it as mod and load the "maledict" map

How to import in Ruiner:
- simply copy the file "maledict.pk4" in your mod folder.
- in doom_main.script add, somewhere after the declaration of "ai_monster_base.script" (where you declared the Guardian stuff is ok):

Code:
#include "script/ai_fake.script"
#include "script/ai_monster_boss_maledict.script"
#include "script/ai_monster_boss_maledict_walking.script"
#include "script/projectile_maledict.script"

- ok, what we've done should generate a problem with my old guardian script
To solve this you have to open ai_monster_boss_guardian.script, go to the end of file and delete:

Code:
/***********************************************************************

ai_fake

***********************************************************************/



object ai_fake : monster_base {
   // States
   void      state_Begin();
   void      state_Idle();
   void      init();

};


/*
=====================
ai_fake::init
=====================
*/
void ai_fake::init() {
   ignoreDamage();
   becomeNonSolid();
   setState( "state_Begin" );
}

void ai_fake::state_Begin() {
        setState( "state_Idle" );
}

void ai_fake::state_Idle() {;}


- done.

How it works:
I suggest to copy in you map folder also the testmap included in the zip, so that you can test if everything is ok and look at what I've done in it.

- The flying and the walking monster need to be both palced in the map and - as you can see in the entity inspector- they have an extra key: you need to set on each of them the name of the other one.
- The flying one has a lot of targets red and green. 
The green ones are the points where he can teleport from ground to air. (the closer one will be chosen)
The red ones are the points where he can teleport from air to ground. (the closer one will be chosen)
If you don't set any target, he will simply teleport up/down where he previously was.


- The energy is shared, and you can set it,as usual, in the editor on the flying one. The energy of the walking one is ignored.

- The monster always starts with the flying one, that only supports the "hide" key. 
The walking one is automatically hidden at the beginning of the map and you don't need to set any key on it.

- you have to place an extra wall of monster clip, like in the testmap, to stop him from clip in the wall while preforming his flying attacks.  


Ok, I know that some projectiles could need some changes to fit the player speed and some variables could be edited based on the size of the place. Let me know, when you need it, what changes are necessary.
