RUIN BLADE MECHANICS 2018
Copy of the mechanics document on Rivensin's mod db site

The Ruin Blade has received an over haul for the 2018 patch. This document details doing finishing moves, directional, light & heavy attacks and damage amounts.


In the 2010 build the sword attacks were determined by which direction the player was holding. They could also move while attacking. 
Alternating the attack and alt attack keys would trigger finishing moves. These were the same moves which could be done through a sequence of keys as well... similar to Mortal Kombat. The system was not fully utilized due to lack of animations. It also feels off swinging a sword and moving at the same time. Because of this the player didn't really have to think and there weren't many benefits to using the finishing moves or directional attacks.

Before detailing how the new system works, one needs to understand how enemies react to pain in Rivensin. 
Enemies have a set amount of damage needed to trigger a high pain animation. Think of this as a stun system. Enemies will stop attacking while it is happening and some will fall down. The amount varies per enemy. How often this can happen is also set to prevent spamming. Player attacks have the ability to bypass the pain gauge, add to the enemy's pain gauge and not add to the pain gauge. In the 2010 build almost all melee combat just added to the pain gauge. A few did force it, such as pistol whips and finishing moves. It is also worth noting that some enemies feel no pain such as the Mancubus, and Revenant.

FINISHERS
Finishing moves are done via sequence of key presses. They are very simple and fast to perform. Rivensin's enemies are aggressive and don't stand around waiting to attack. The inputs in the 2018 release are easier to perform than the 2010 versions to make them more useful. Each move has it's benefits. Damage amounts, when the damage occurs during the animations and ability to stun or not stun the enemy have been updated.

TIPS & TRICKS:
-Animation Cancelling: medium attacks, heavy attacks, and finishers cancel out light attacks. You can use this to your advantage to chain attacks together and increase damage output quicker
-The cleave attack can be done in the air. It is the strongest attack you can do off the ground
-The player is free to move and light attack at the same time if they are crouched.
-The color of the trail the sword makes during swings helps indicate what type of attack is playing.
