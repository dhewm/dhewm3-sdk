# ELDOOM

A singleplayer campaign for Doom3 with lots of action.  
A full story from beginning to end. High quality portal skies. Large custom quality maps.
Always run with no stamina (toggleable on/off). Slightly modified weapons (toggleable on/off).
Classic nightmare mode (toggleable on/off). New custom cinematics and animations and much more...

After compiling the source, you can start the game with

A big THANK YOU to "Ez0n3" (and the rest of the ELDOOM Team) for releasing this mod under GPL
