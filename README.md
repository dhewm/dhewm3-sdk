# Desolated - The Crying Fate

Desolated - The Crying Fate is a Total Conversion based on Doom 3.
It comes with a complete new storyline about the shade between good and evil plus two other gamemodes.
A quest-, rpg- and moneysystem are just a few of the many new game mechanics that will await you.
If you want to see everything you'll need at least 7-8 hours... but let the game speak for itself,
download and have fun playing!
